import numpy as np
a = np.array([[10, 11, 12],
 [13, 14, 15],
 [16, 17, 18],

 [22, 23, 24],

# x[start:stop:step]

# Another useful type of operation is reshaping of arrays. The most flexible way of doing this is with the reshape method. For example, if you want to put the numbers 1 through 9 in a 3Ã—3
#  grid, you can do the following:
x.reshape((3, 1))

# Concatenation of arrays
# Concatenation, or joining of two arrays in NumPy, is primarily accomplished using the routines np.concatenate,
# np.vstack, and np.hstack. np.concatenate takes a tuple or list of arrays as its first argument, as we can see here:
# no.vstack for column wise contatenation
# similarly split funtion works in  oppositeway and hsplit for dividing the rowsin equal  parts
left, right = np.hsplit(a, [2])
print(left)
print(right)
