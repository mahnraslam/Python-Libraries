'''
Player A is consistent with scores close to the mean.
Player B is inconsistent with scores far from the mean
Think of Player A as a student who gets similar marks in all exams, making their average predictable.
Think of Player B as a student who does extremely well in some exams and very poorly in others, making their average less predictable.
How to find consistency?
    Range: Smaller range indicates more consistency.  
    Range = max - min

    Variance: Lower variance indicates more consistency.
    Variance= ((24-25)**2 + (26-26)**2) // 2  = 1 while for b is 625

    Standard Deviation: Lower standard deviation indicates more consistency.
    std = np.sqrt(var)
    Standard Deviation= np.sqrt(625) =25

    Coefficient of Variation: Lower CV indicates more consistency.
    formula  CV= œÉ(std) / ùúá(mean)
    a = 0.04 
    b = 25//25 equals to 1

why there is a need of std when we have variance ?
Disadvantage of variance : Variance is in squared units of the original data, making it less interpretable in practical terms. For example, if the data is in meters, the variance will be in square meters.
That's why it is necessary to find the std.

2 why there is a need of CV equal to std//mean like 1//25 0.04 for player a
Coefficient of Variation (CV) is a useful measure to compare the relative variability of different datasets, particularly when the means are different.
